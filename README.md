# VisualSolana (*.vsol)

VisualSolana is a VS Code extension for rapid prototyping of programs that run on Solana.

## About

The VisualSolana plugin is built on [the Blockly project](https://developers.google.com/blockly) and implements both custom blocks and custom generator to generate Rust code.

VisualSolana implements two components in the development cycle:
* An interface language to simplify prototyping complex memory structures
* A visual programming language for backend implementation
